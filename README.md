# Live plot of speed and time to understand congestion in New York

Authors:  **Vijay Ganesh Srinivasan** and **Ramakrishna Polepeddi**

## Introduction
- The objective of the program is to capture live data and plot the speed and time to understand the congestion in the New York boroughs.
- The basic understanding behind the bubble plot is when speed is more, time will be less and traffic will be less. When the speed is less, the time taken by the vehicle in the same road will be more and the congestion will be more.
- More the traffic, bigger the bubble. The comparison is relative.
- For this program we have taken the Real-Time Traffic Speed Data from the NYC OpenData.

## About the data
- #### *The best part about the data is it will be frequently updated on hourly basis.*
- This data feed contains 'real-time' traffic information from locations where Department Of Traffic picks up sensor feeds within the five boroughs, mostly on major arterials and highways. DOT uses this information for emergency response and management.
- The data will be available in .csv, .json and .geojson formats. The reason for using a .json type of data format over .csv is JSON is better at showing hierarchical / relational data, CSV will lose data, The standard CSV reader application is not good as it is compared with json and last but not least, JSON is easier to work with at scale.**For better picture even than the above explanation the data what we captured here, when we downloaded it as .csv, the size of the file was 3.9Gb.**

## Things to do before executing this program or learning this program
- The code uses the functions and modules of Socrata to perform the operations within the code. To learn about Real Time Traffic Speed Data from Socrata and its functions [click HERE](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/i4gi-tjb9)

## Explanation of the Code

**Code summary**


![Image of Plot](https://github.com/IE-555/api-vijay-ganesh-srinivasan-ramakrishna-polepeddi/blob/master/images/Capture_2.PNG)

**The uploaded code is executed in the Jupyter environment. If you're trying to execute using Spyder, Windows Powershell or Apple command prompt the method may or may not vary**

The uploaded code `Live_Traffic_Data.py` needs the following packages to be present. If not try installing it:
```
Pandas
Folium
Socrata from Sodapy
```
Mostly anyone using Python will have Pandas. The above 2 packages Folium and Sodapy could be installed as follows
```
$ pip install folium
or
$ conda install folium

```
Sodapy could be installed as `pip install sodapy`. For more details on Sodapy read the documentation mentioned in **Things to do before executing this program or learning this program**


```

#Accessing data from Socrata - Real time Traffic
client = Socrata("data.cityofnewyork.us","CEjJtZpnruNltsucUPQkL4szd")
results_list = client.get("i4gi-tjb9",select="travel_time,speed,borough,link_points")
results_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(results_list)
df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(results_df)
df.head()
display(df)

```
- The above code is used for grabbing the data from the website directly.
- The most important thing to create when we consider grab a data from a live data set is API token. Each and every user has a separate API token and each and every data set in Socrata has separate identifier. Here "i4gi-tjb9" is identifier for the data set we are using and "CEjJtZpnruNltsucUPQkL4szd" is API token.
- Providing the username and password along with API token will allow access to many options.
- After grabbing the live data frame we can display it using `display(df)` command.

Structured Data from the website:

The raw data is shown below as structured one by converting it into a dataframe using pandas.

**Challenge faced when calculating the mean speed and mean time**

The data captured from the mentioned site was in the `object` format which was found out to be `string`. To perform numerical operations the data has to be converted in to float. The command used `astype` to convert the datatype of existing data.

```
#Grouping of the data according to the borough and calculating the mean speed
groupby_borough = df['travel_time'].groupby(df['borough'])
groupby_borough
df.travel_time = df.travel_time.astype(float)
df['travel_time'].dtype
list(df['travel_time'].groupby(df['borough']))
#df.groupby('borough')['speed'].mean()
average_travel_time=df.groupby('borough')['travel_time'].mean().values.tolist()

```

The above code explains the converstion of the data type and calculating mean speed and time.

**Folium code explanation:**

- The type of map used here is openstreetmap from Folium. There are lot of maps. Based on the usage we could select which tile we need.
- The first step is setting the home position for the map. Here it's NY. The co-ordinates of the NY is given.
- The co-ordinates of the boroughs are added to the map one by one as markers
- Finally the output for both speed and time is displayed.

```
#Folium maps for the display of the final output
map = folium.Map(location=[40.7128, -74.0060],tiles="openstreetmap",zoom_start=10)
for i in range(0,len(data)):
    folium.Marker([data.iloc[i]['lat'], data.iloc[i]['lon']], popup=data.iloc[i]['name']).add_to(map)
# Adding marker one by one
for i in range(0,len(data)):
    folium.Circle(location=[data.iloc[i]['lat'], data.iloc[i]['lon']],popup=data.iloc[i]['name'],radius=data.iloc[i]['value_speed']*100,color='crimson',fill=True,fill_color='crimson' ).add_to(map)    
display(map)
#Folium maps for the display of the final output
map = folium.Map(location=[40.7128, -74.0060],tiles="openstreetmap",zoom_start=10)
for i in range(0,len(data)):
    folium.Marker([data.iloc[i]['lat'], data.iloc[i]['lon']], popup=data.iloc[i]['name']).add_to(map)
# Adding marker one by one
for i in range(0,len(data)):
    folium.Circle(location=[data.iloc[i]['lat'], data.iloc[i]['lon']],popup=data.iloc[i]['name'],radius=data.iloc[i]['value_time']*5,color='purple',fill=True,fill_color='purple' ).add_to(map)
display(map)

```

## Suggestions

- We could make this data interact with the weather api which helps in giving the weather conditions and the traffic based on the weather. For example if it is a heavy snowy day then there could be a possibility of traffic in roads.

- There are latitude and longitude data provided for the route taken by the vehicle. This information helps us to get a clear picture on a specific location of congestion.

- For statistical analysis of the significant reason we could classify the reasons for traffic into bad weather, workzone, poor traffic timings, accidents and determine which is more responsible for traffic. A step ahead we could give a travel tip on which day to travel based on the traffic data we hold.
